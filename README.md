🧠 About Me
I am Hari, a dedicated Data Analyst with expertise in Excel, Power BI, and SQL. I specialize in data cleaning, analysis, and visualization to help organizations uncover trends, identify growth opportunities, and make strategic decisions that drive business success.

🚀 About the Project
This project focuses on analyzing key business data to uncover insights into sales performance, product trends, and regional growth. By leveraging Excel for data extraction, transformation, and visualization, I built interactive dashboards to provide actionable insights that can guide business decision-making and drive growth.

🔑 Key Insights

Total revenue grew by $2.4 million from 2018 to 2019, showcasing strong business growth.
A remarkable 200% increase in profit during the same period demonstrates improved operational efficiency and scalability.
2. Regional Insights:
Canada emerged as the top-performing region, contributing the highest total sales, indicating successful strategies in this market.
The United States, however, showed the lowest sales, pointing to a significant opportunity for targeted strategies and marketing efforts to boost performance.
3. Product Insights:
The White Chocolate Macadamia Nut cookie saw the highest sales growth, signaling a growing customer preference for this product.
On the other hand, the Chocolate Chip cookie experienced minimal growth, suggesting the need for a re-evaluation of product offerings and marketing strategies.
