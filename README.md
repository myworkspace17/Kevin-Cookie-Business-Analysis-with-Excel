üëã Hi, I‚Äôm Hari (@myworkspace17)
Welcome to my GitHub! I'm a Data Enthusiast passionate about uncovering actionable insights from data and creating compelling visualizations that help businesses make informed decisions.

Project Overview
In this project, I performed a comprehensive analysis of Kevin Cookies Company‚Äôs sales, revenue, and profit data from 2018 and 2019 to provide actionable insights. The goal was to help the company improve business performance, optimize strategies, and enhance decision-making processes. I used Excel for data cleaning, transformation, analysis, and visualization, and PowerPoint (PPT) to present the insights to stakeholders. Additionally, I enhanced the Excel workbook's functionality by creating navigation buttons to easily switch between different sheets, improving the overall user experience.

Procedure Followed:
1. Data Collection and Cleaning:
Collected Data: Compiled sales data for 2018 and 2019.
Data Cleaning:
Removed duplicate records to ensure data integrity.
Handled missing values to maintain consistency.
Standardized column values (e.g., converted "1" to "Churned" and "0" to "Not Churned").
2. Data Transformation:
Structured Data: Organized the raw data into a structured format using Excel.
Calculated Key Metrics: Created new columns for profit margins, growth percentages, and other key metrics to track performance.
Aggregated Data: Consolidated sales data by region, product, and year for analysis.
3. Data Analysis and Insights Generation:
Excel PivotTables: Used PivotTables in Excel to analyze sales trends by region, product type, and year.
Product Performance Analysis: Identified which products generated the highest revenue and which ones underperformed.
Year-over-Year Comparison: Compared 2018 vs 2019 data for revenue, profit, and growth to reveal key trends.
4. Data Visualization and Presentation:
Charts and Graphs: Created Excel charts (bar, line, and pie charts) to visualize trends in sales, revenue, and profit.
PowerPoint (PPT): Created a PowerPoint presentation to showcase the business analysis findings, key insights, and recommendations to stakeholders.
Navigation Buttons:
Created interactive buttons in Excel to allow users to seamlessly navigate between different sheets within the workbook.
Enhanced the workbook's usability by making it easier for stakeholders to access different sections of the analysis and data.
